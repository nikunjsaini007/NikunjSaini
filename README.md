# 🌐 Nikunj Saini — Portfolio Website

This is my **first ever project**, where I tried building my own portfolio website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

The portfolio showcases:
- My journey as a **content creator** (since 2018 on YouTube & Instagram)  
- My growing interests in **programming, AI, gaming, automobiles, and aviation**  
- A section about me, my projects, and ways to connect with me  

### 🚀 Features
- Responsive design
- Highlighted skills and interests  
- Simple project cards for my work    

### 🔗 Live Website

💡 This is just the **beginning of my web development journey**. More projects and improvements coming soon!
